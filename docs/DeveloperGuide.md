## Introduction
### Background
SCRUMptious is a Java-based command line interface application for you to efficiently manage the development of a project. Leveraging the robust SCRUM/Agile framework, it allows you to delegate tasks to your team members and organize project requirements with ease. As a bonus, if you are a keyboard warrior, you can reach peak efficiency using SCRUMptious to manage your projects.

### Purpose
This guide illustrates the general architecture, and software design of SCRUMptious.

### Scope
This guide is geared towards developers who wish to enhance or create their own version of SCRUMptious. As such, it contains important information regarding the software architecture and design considerations of SCRUMptious.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
1. JDK 11.
1. IntelliJ IDEA.

### Setting Up
1. Use a Git tool to fork this repository, or download the .zip file from GitHub and extract the contents into a new folder.
1. Right-Click on the folder and select “Open folder as Intellij IDEA Community Edition Project”.
1. Ensure JDK 11 is selected for Gradle, by navigating to Configure > Structure for New Projects > Project Settings > Project > Project SDK.

### Running the Program
This program can be run once it is compiled. If you have built its artifacts (.jar) file, you may run it using java -jar <filename.jar> on your command line.

## Design
This section seeks to explain the high-level design of the application. Given below is a quick overview of each component and the explanation of the design architecture in greater detail.
SCRUMptious is the main class of the application, and handles the initializing and execution of the appropriate classes.
### Architecture
![Figure X: Architecture Diagram](./image/developerguide/architecturediagram.png "Architecture Diagram UML")  
The **Architecture Diagram** shown above describes the high level association operations of the application. 
A quick overview of the components is as follows:

`Main` is single-class component of `SCRUMptious`. It is responsible for:
1. At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence(Storage, UI, Parser), and links them together where appropriate.
1. At program exit: Invokes Storage component to save all unsaved data.

The other packages are described below: 
1. `UI` : The user interface of the app, reads user input and is visible to the user.
1. `Parser Manager` : The module that reads user inputs, and creates a suitable parser based on the command to make 
 sense of user input. Respective parser then tells the Command module what to execute.
1. `ProjectManager` : Manages and stores all the projects added by the user, keeps track of selected project.    
1. `SprintManager` : Stores all sprints associated with a project.
1. `TaskManager` : Stores all tasks in backlog associated with a project.
1. `ProjectMembers` : Stores all team-members associated to a project. 
1. `Parser` : Creates a suitable parser, based on the command to make sense of the user input. Respective parser then
 make use the information and call respective commands. 
 
Each of the modules listed above are a collection of constituent classes, with each handling specialized tasks in-line with the SLAP principle.

### UI Component
![Figure X: Simplified class diagram for UI Component](./image/developerguide/UI.png "User Interface")  

### Logic Component
The `Logic` component contains the `ParserManager` and its subclasses, and the `Command` class and its subclasses, which mainly handles the commands input by the user. 
![Figure X: Simplified class diagram for Logic Component](./image/developerguide/parserandcommand.png)

When a user types a command, `SCRUMptious`calls the `ParserManager`. The `ParserManager` then parses commands from the user. Subsequently, 
the `ParserManager` passes the commands on to the respective exceptions parsers which inherit from the `ExceptionsParser` interface. 
The exceptions parsers consist of:  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1. `ProjectParser`<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. `MemberParser`<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3. `TaskParser`<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4. `SprintParser`<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5. `HelpParser`<br>

1. The `ProjectParser` validates the parameters of the command. If the command is valid, it returns the respective `ProjectCommandXYZ` to the `ParserManager`.
If the command is invalid, the `ProjectParser` returns an appropriate warning message to the user.  

1. The `MemberParser` validates the parameters of the command. If the command is valid, it returns the respective `MemberCommandXYZ` to the `ParserManager`.
If the command is invalid, the `TaskParser` returns an appropriate warning message to the user.  

1. The `TaskParser` validates the parameters of the command. If the command is valid, it returns the respective `TaskCommandXYZ` to the `ParserManager`.
If the command is invalid, the `TaskParser` returns an appropriate warning message to the user.  

1. The `SprintParser` validates the parameters of the command. If the command is valid, it returns the respective `SprintCommandXYZ` to the `ParserManager`.
If the command is invalid, the `SprintParser` returns an appropriate warning message to the user.  

1. The `HelpParser` validates the parameters of the command. If the command is valid, it returns the respective `HelpParserCommandXYZ` to the `ParserManager`.
If the command is invalid, the `HelpParser` returns an appropriate warning message to the user.

The subcommand classes `XYZHelpCommand`, `XYZProjectCommand`, `XYZMemberCommand`, `XYZTaskCommand`, `XYZSprintCommand` all inherit from an abstract `Command` class, 
which has an execute function.

The `ParserManager` then returns the command back to `SCRUMptious`, which then executes the command.

![Figure X: Simplified class diagram for Command Component](./image/developerguide/commandClassDiagram.png "Command
 Class Diagram")  

A detailed list of the subcommand classes is described in the diagram above.

### Model Component
![Figure X: Simplified class diagram for Model Component](./image/developerguide/modelcomponent.png "Storage Component UML")  
[Model Package](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-F11-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/duke/model)  
The Model package defines all the object classes that are used by SCRUMptious and this section will explain how these objects interact with other components and each other.

#### Initialisation
* Upon starting the program, SCRUMptious will initialise one instance of `ProjectManager` which will be used to facilitate all the operation in the program.

#### Operation - Command Execution
When a `Command` from the [Logic component](#logic-component) is executed, it will work on the same `ProjectManager` initialised previously and will branch down to the necessary packages as required.

##### Project Operations
* `ProjectManager` facilitate the management of multiple `Project` instances.
    * Creation of `Project` adds an entry to `ProjectManager`.
    * Deletion of `Project` removes an entry from `ProjectManager`.
* `Project` contain necessary information about the project such as:
    * Project ID
    * Project Title
    * Project Description
    * Project Duration
    * Sprint Length
    * Project Start Date
    * Project End Date
* `Project` hold three additional object that are initialise upon its creation:
    * `ProjectMembers` to facilitate the management of `Members` that are working on the `Project`.
    * `SprintManager` to facilitate the management of `Sprint` iterations that belongs to the `Project`.
    * `TaskManager` to facilitate the management of `Tasks` that are broken down from the `Project`.
##### Members Operations
* `ProjectMembers` facilitate the management of multiple `Members` instances and is dependant on the `Project` that initialises it.
    * Creation of `Member` adds an entry to `ProjectMembers`.
    * Deletion of `Member` removes an entry from `ProjectMembers`.
* `Member` contain the Member's user ID.

##### Task Operations
* `TaskManager` facilitate the management of multiple `Task` instances and is dependant on the `Project` that initialises it.
    * Creation of `Task` adds an entry to `TaskManager`.
    * Deletion of `Task` removes an entry from `TaskManager`.
* `Task` contain necessary information about the task such as:
    * Task ID
    * Task Title
    * Task Description
    * Task Priority
    * Task Completion Status
* `Task` contain two additional ArrayList that are initialise upon its creation:
    * ArrayList of Member's user ID to keep track `Members` who are assigned to work on the task.
    * ArrayList of Sprint ID to keep track `Sprints` that the task are allocated to.

##### Sprint Operations
* `SprintManager` will facilitate the management of multiple `Sprint` instances and is dependant on the `Project` that initialises it.
    * Creation of `Sprint` adds an entry to `SprintManager`.
* `Sprint` contain necessary information about the iteration such as:
    * Sprint ID
    * Sprint Goal
    * Sprint Start Date
    * Sprint End Date
* `Sprint` contain one additional ArrayList that are initialise upon its creation:
    * ArrayList of Task IDs to keep track `Tasks` that are allocated to the `Sprint`.
### Storage Component
![Figure X: Simplified class diagram for Storage Component, Model and json.simple](./image/developerguide/storagecomponent.png "Storage Component UML") 
API: [StorageManager.java]( https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-F11-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/duke/storage/StorageManager.java)  
The Storage component is using the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) to save the data. The library used for serialising and deserializing the data is _json.simple 3.1.1_ by **Clifton Labs**.  
As shown in the diagram above, `JsonableObject` and `JsonableArray` are interfaces which inherits the `Jsonable` interface. The following model class inherits only one of the two interfaces:  
- ProjectManager  
- Project  
- SprintManager  
- TaskManager  
- ProjectMembers  
- Sprint  
- Task  
- Member  

This requires the model classes to implement two methods required for JSON serialisation and deserialisation:  
- `toJson()`: Contains logic required to convert the model object into JSON string.  
- `fromJson()`: Contains logic required to convert JSON object into its respective model class.    

## Implementation
### Project
![Figure X: Project Class Diagram](./image/developerguide/ProjectClassDiagram.png
 "Project Class Diagram")
#### Create Project
![Figure X: Sequence diagram of CreateProjectCommand](./image/developerguide/)
 "Add Project Sequence Diagram") 
 Link: [CreateProjectCommand.java](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-F11-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/duke/command/project/CreateProjectCommand.java) 
A project is created with a clear title and description of what the team is working on 
for delivery, as well as the project length and the sprint duration specified. `ProjectManager` stores all the projects
in a hash table with `projectID`, `project` as key,value pair.

Before execution:
1. Parse user input `project /create -title <title> -desc <description> -dur <duration> -sd <sprint interval>` into Command

    SCRUMptious will receive user input using the `Ui` class and parse it into `CreateProjectCommand` with `Parser` and
     `ProjectParser`.
1. Execute CreateProjectCommand

    SCRUMptious calls `Command.execute()` which will execute the command as mentioned in the implementation.

Implementation:

1. Prepare parameters
    1. Extracts required fields, to be passed as parameters for project creation.
        
1. `projectManager.addProject()` adds a project using the parameters provided.
    
1. Output to User
    
    `printCreatedProject()` is then called to output the newly created Project in `addProj.toString` via `Ui
    .showToUserLn()`

#### List Project
All the projects added by the user are shown as an output.
Before execution:
1. Parse user input `project /list` into Command

    SCRUMptious will receive user input using the `Ui` class and parse it into `ListProjectCommand` with `Parser` and
     `ProjectParser`.
     
1. Execute ListProjectCommand

    SCRUMptious calls `Command.execute()` which will execute the command as mentioned in the implementation.

Implementation:

1. The program iterates through `projectManager.getProjectList()` to get a list of all the projects stored in
 `ProjectManager`.
    
1. Output to User
    
    `proj.getTitle()` and `proj.getDescription()` is then called to output all the projects in `ProjectManager` via
     `Ui.showToUserLn()`.

#### Select Project
Select the project on which all the commands are executed.

Before execution:
1. Parse user input `project /select <id>` into Command

    SCRUMptious will receive user input using the `Ui` class and parse it into `SelectProjectCommand` with `Parser` and
     `ProjectParser`.
     
1. Execute SelectProjectCommand

    SCRUMptious calls `Command.execute()` which will execute the command as mentioned in the implementation. The
     required project will then be chosen as reference and stored in `ProjectManager`.

Implementation:

1. The input `id` is used to access the corresponding project stored in a hashtable in the `projectManager`.
    
1. Output to User
    
    `parameters.get('0')` is used to get the selected id and generate output  via
     `Ui.showToUserLn()`.


#### View Project
View the details of the project on which the user is currently working on.
Before execution:
1. Parse user input `project /vuew` into Command

    SCRUMptious will receive user input using the `Ui` class and parse it into `ViewProjectCommand` with `Parser` and
     `ProjectParser`.
     
1. Execute ViewProjectCommand

    SCRUMptious calls `Command.execute()` which will execute the command as mentioned in the implementation.

Implementation:

1. The selected project is accessed by using `projectManager.getSelectedProject()`.
    
1. Output to User
    
    The project is shown to the user by `proj.toString()` via `Ui.showToUserLn()`

### Task
#### Add Task
A task is created following the creation of a project, with a clear title, description 
and priority of the task.
Command executed by user `task /add -title <title> -desc <description> -priority <priority>`
is passed, the following operations are implemented:
* UI receives user input and passes it to Parser class.
* Parser checks if the input format is valid and if a project exists, and executes a corresponding AddTaskCommand 
object.
* A new task is created, and added to project manager.
    
#### View Task
#### Delete Task
An existing task is deleted when the user wishes to remove a completed or unnecessary task. The task
ID is provided.
Command executed by user `task /del -id`
is passed, the following operations are implemented:
* UI receives user input and passes it to Parser class.
* Parser checks if the id entered is valid, and executes a corresponding DeleteTaskCommand 
    object.
* The corresponding task is deleted from the program.
    
#### Change Task Priority
An existing task can have its priority changed when the user wishes to re-rank the urgency of the task. The task
ID and the new priority are provided.
Command executed by user `task /priority -priority HIGH -id 1`
is passed, the following operations are implemented:
* UI receives user input and passes it to Parser class.
* Parser checks if the id and priority entered is valid, and executes a corresponding ChangeTaskPriorityCommand 
    object.
* The corresponding task will have its priority updated in the program.
    
#### Mark Task as Complete    
An existing task can be marked as complete when the user completes the task. The task
ID is provided.
Command executed by user `task /done -id`
is passed, the following operations are implemented:
* UI receives user input and passes it to Parser class.
* Parser checks if the id entered is valid, and executes a corresponding DoneTaskCommand 
    object.
* The corresponding task is marked as done in the program.
    
### Sprint
In SCRUMptious, a Project will be broken down into smaller iterations known as Sprints. The Sprint will contain information about the Tasks allocated for that iteration and Members that are assigned to complete the Tasks.

The following section will explain how the management of Sprints is implemented in the program.

#### Create Sprint

![Figure X: Sequence diagram of CreateSprintCommand](./image/developerguide/createSprint.png "Create Sprint Sequence Diagram")  
  
Link: [CreateSprintCommand.java](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-F11-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/duke/command/sprint/CreateSprintCommand.java) 

A Sprint can be created when there is an existing Project.
When the Project is created, the duration of the Project and length of the Sprints are specified, thus, there will be a finite number of Sprints for each Project.


Usage scenario:
1. Parse user input into Command

    SCRUMptious will receive user input using the `Ui` class and parse it into `CreateSprintCommand` with `Parser` and `SprintParser`.
1. Execute CreateSprintCommand

    SCRUMptious calls `Command.execute()` which will execute the command as mentioned in the implementation.

1. Choose the Project to add the new Sprint

    `chooseProject()` will be called to check for the optional `-project` tag in the user specified parameters.
    
    Note: If the tag is not specified, the default Project in the ProjectManager indexed by `selectedProject` will be chosen.
1. Prepare parameters
    
    `prepareParameters()` will be called to check for the mandatory `-goal` tag in the user specified parameters.
    In addition, It will also prepare the optional `-start` tag as required in the following two scenarios:
    1. New Sprint is first Sprint in Project
        
        Being the first Sprint in the Project, the `-start` tag will determine the start date for both the new Sprint and Project.
        Thus, the `String` parameter will be sent to _DateTimeParser_ via `parseDate()` to parse it into a _LocalDate_ object.
        
        The end date for the Project and Sprint will also be determined by adding `projectDuration` and `sprintLength` to the start date respectively.
        
    1. New Sprint is not first Sprint in Project
    
        As there is a previous Sprint before the newly created Sprint, the new Sprint will start the day after the previous 
        Sprint ends. Thus, the `-start` tag will be ignored even if specified by user.

1. Check all sprint created

    With all the necessary parameters prepared, the command will check if there is still room to add new Sprint by checking
    if the prepared `sprintEndDate` is after the `projectEndDate`.
    
    Note: This check is done after the `prepareParameters()` as the _LocalDate_ `sprintEndDate` is required.
    
1. Update Project Start and End date if new Sprint is first Sprint

    As mentioned above, if the new Sprint is the first Sprint in the Project, the `-start` tag will determine the start and end date of the Project.
1. Add Sprint to Sprint Manger
    
    `addSprint()` is finally called to add a new Sprint to the Sprint Manager.
   
1. Output to User
    
    `printCreatedSprint()` is then called to output the newly created Sprint in `createdSprint.toString()` via `Ui
    .showToUserLn()`

#### View Sprint

### Storage
To make the data persistent and portable, JSON has been chosen as the format for data to be saved to a persistent storage such as storage drives, thumb drives and any other storage medium which stores the program. JSON is also **human-readable** which allows users to directly modify the data file easily. 
This can be useful in certain scenarios such as fixing the data file in the event of data corruption.

#### Location  
![Figure X: Running the Jar](image/developerguide/storage_save_directory.png "Running the Jar")  
_Figure X: Running the Jar or in IDE_

As shown in the above diagram, the program will save the data as _"data.json"_. The data file is saved in the _“data/”_ folder that is located in the folder of the program. If you are testing the program using Intellij IDE, the _“data/”_ folder will be in the root of the project folder.  
When you start the program, the program will load the data file from its respective location and deserialise it into its respective objects. Data will be saved when the program exits or whenever the user makes changes to the program.  

#### Loading Data
![Figure X: Loading Data](image/developerguide/storage_load.png "Loading Data")  

The program will only load the data file in the persistent storage during the initialisation process of the program. With reference to the sequence diagram above, the flow of the logic is as follows:  
1. When the user starts the program, it will first call `init()` to initialise the program. 
2. A `StorageManager` object will be instantiated with the reference to a `ProjectManager` object that is used during load and save operations.
3. `load()` will read the data file from the persistent storage, deserialise it into a `JsonObject` object and attempt to convert the object into its respective types.  
  
The program will exit immediately with an **exit code 1** if any of the conditions are met:
- Error trying to read the file.
- Conversion error due to missing properties.
- Mapping error due to invalid property type (e.g. "name" is expecting a `String` but data read is an `Integer`).

#### Converting and Mapping of JSON to Objects
Due to the limitations of the library, parsing of the JSON string only converts it into either JsonObject or JsonArray objects which requires additional operations to map the data back to the respective model classes.  
  
As explained in [Storage Component](#storage-component), each model class except for `Priority` will inherit either `JsonableObject` or `JsonableArray` which are custom interfaces inheriting the `Jsonable` interface of _**json.simple**_. This requires the classes to implement the methods `toJson()` and `fromJson()`. This section will focus on `fromJson()`, which is used to implement the logic for **converting and mapping of JSON to objects of their respective type**.  
  
1. After loading the raw JSON string, `StorageManager` will call `Jsoner.deserialize()` to convert it into an object of `JsonObject`.
2. At this point, `JsonObject` contains all the properties of `ProjectManager` and needs to be mapped back to a `ProjectManager` object.
3. `StorageManager` will call `ProjectManager.fromJson()`, passing the `JSONObject` object from _Step 2_ as the parameter. 
4. In `fromJson()`, there are two type of actions depending on the property it is mapping:  
   1. **Type Casting**: Properties that are primitive or standard can be mapped directly through type casting (e.g. `int`, `boolean`, `String` etc.)
   2. **\*Calling `fromJson()` of the Actual Type**: Any property that is originally a type of the **Scrumptious model classes** will be mapped with the following steps:
      1. Create an empty object of the respective type (e.g. `Sprint`).
      2. Type cast the property as `JsonObject` or `JsonArray` depending on the actual type of the property (e.g. `(JsonArray) object`).
      3. Call `fromJson()` of the newly created object, passing the property as the parameter (e.g. `Sprint.fromJson()`).
      4. New object's `fromJson()` will **repeat the same process again under Step 4** for its own properties.  
      
* `Priority` is an **enum** and is the only model which does not follow this strictly. It is mapped by type casting
 the property as `String` first, then calling the `Priority.valueOf()` method to convert it into its respective **enum**.  

#### Saving Data
![Figure X: Saving Data](image/developerguide/storage_save.png "Saving Data")  

Data will be saved under two scenarios: 
1. When the program exits. 
1. Changes made to the data. 

##### When the Program Exits
`Scrumptious` will call `destroy()` which calls `save()` before it returns.

##### Changes Made to the Data
Changes made to the data during the runtime of the program can only be made by executing a command.
   
As shown in the diagram above, each command class inherits the `shouldSave` property from `Command` class. `shouldSave` is a boolean variable and is initialised inside the constructor. `shouldSave` will be set to `true` if the command results in a change of data (e.g. adding a task, creating a sprint etc.), otherwise it is set to `false` (e.g. viewing projects, sprints etc.).

After executing the command by calling `execute()`, the program will call `save()` from `StorageManager` object if the `shouldSave` is set to `true`.

##### Serialising Objects to JSON
As explained in [Storage Component](#storage-component), each model class except for `Priority` will inherit either `JsonableObject` or `JsonableArray` which are custom interfaces inheriting the `Jsonable` interface of _**json.simple**_. This requires the classes to implement the methods `toJson()` and `fromJson()`. This section will focus on `toJson()`, which is used to implement the logic for **serialising objects into JSON string**.  
When saving the data as JSON file, `StorageManager` will call `Jsoner.serialize()` of the _**json.simple**_, passing in the `ProjectManager` and `FileWriter` (points to the data file) object as the parameters. The library will automatically serialise the objects and sub-objects into JSON string depending on the type of the objects:
 1. **Primitive and Standard Types (e.g. `int`, `String`, `Collection`)**: The library can directly serialise these types into JSON string.
 2. **Scrumptious Model Types (e.g. `Project`, `Task`)**: The library will serialise these types by calling its `toJson()` method which contains the logic for the serialisation.  
    
* `Priority` is an exception, it is serialised by calling `name()` of the **enum** which will return its `String
` representation.
